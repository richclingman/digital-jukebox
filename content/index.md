# K0OZK, Ozark, Missouri, USA

## Hi! It's me! (Who else would it be?)

My name's Rich Clingman, <Callsign></Callsign> in Ozark, Missouri, U.S.A.

## The history of a Ham

I was first licensed as Technician Class Amateur Radio Operator in 1976.
I'm guessing that I got one of the first "N" calls: <Callsign>N7AEK</Callsign>.
I built a Heathkit QRP rig and got discouraged trying to do CW.
License expired. Mostly unused.

Well, this photo is evidence that I wasn't totally without Hamming.
I helped operated the
Navy MARS (Military Affiliate Radio System) station
aboard the USS Kitty Hawk (CV63) on 1977-78 WestPac deployment.
Long before the days of Internet and email, the way sailors contacted
family and friends was by mail (four to six weeks), or by message
or phone patch with the help of volunteers at the shipboard MARS station.
This photo was used in an article in the shipboard newspaper.

## Stupid Morse Code!

While moving in 2011, I came across my old CW key and thought,
"If only I didn't need to know Morse Code." \(Insert sad face here.)
After a little investigation, I found that code was no longer required!
(Happy face.)
I studied for Technician and felt confident. (I'd been an Avionics Tech in the Navy.)
Then, I found out I could take multiple tests and so I
took all three (Tech, General, Extra).

## *Almost Extra.* Extra!

I earned General.
I missed Extra by one question--you know, that question where you say,
"I know it's *that* answer, but I'm going to choose *this* answer."
So, that week I studied more seriously and passed Extra. (Another happy face.)
I used 
<a href="https://www.hamradiolicenseexam.com/" target="_blank">Ham Test Online</a> 
to study.
They're still around, and the website looks the same.
Don't let that put you off. They still have one of the best exam prep services available.

For several years, with my local club in Ramona, California, I was Network Control for our weekly net.
I also helped with some test prep and exams, but did little else.

## I've been a "7", a "6", now a "<Callsign>0</Callsign>"

When, in 2019, I moved to Ozark, Missouri, I decided to get a local "<Callsign>0</callsign>" callsign
and get more involved in Ham.
I found that <Callsign></Callsign> was available and got that.
But I still hadn't done anything with my license.

Now, in 2023, wanting to get back into using my Amateur Radio License a bit more,
I joined the
<a href="https://www.nixahams.net/" target="_blank">Nixa Amateur Radio Club</a>. They have an amazing set of repeaters in the
<a href="https://smlrs.info/" target="_blank">Southwest Missouri Linked Repeater System</a>.

## Band Plan

I started looking into the Ham band plan (what frequencies are available and what emissions are allowed). 
There were a lot of PDFs you can download.
But there didn't seem to be an interactive app available for that, so I began working on 
<a href="https://bandplan.info/" target="_blank">BandPlan.info</a>.

## Rattle and Ribbit

In August, 2023, I learned about a cool emerging called 
<a href="https://www.ribbitradio.org/" target="_blank">Ribbit Radio</a>.
It proposes to use our smartphones with our Amateur Radio HTs (Handheld Transcivers) to more
reliably and quickly pass messages. The developers have created test/demonstration applications
for Android and IOS.

In my excitement, within a couple days, I created a 
<a href="https://courageous-llama-29036b.netlify.app/" target="_blank">PWA (Progressive Web Application)</a>
to test the use of Ahmet Inan's DSP C++ library plus WASM (Web Assembly) as a single-application
alternative that might support all mobile and desktop/laptop devices.
